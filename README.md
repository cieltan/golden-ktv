# Golden-KTV

## Summary

Hello! Welcome to Golden-KTV, a fullstack application for karaoke lovers! Our application was built with React, Redux, Node, Express, PostgresSQL, Sequelize, OpenTok API, Socket.io, and Youtube Data API.

Our team consisted of Jenny Wong, Billy Tan, Aaron Nah, and Mia Baz.

## Start

`npm run start-dev` will make great things happen!

If you want to run the server and/or webpack separately, you can also `npm run start-server` and `npm run build-client`.

From there, just follow your bliss.
