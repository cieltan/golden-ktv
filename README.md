# Golden-KTV

Looking to mix up a backend with express/sequelize and a frontend with react/redux? That's `boilermaker`!

Follow along with the workshop to make your own! This canonical version can serve as a reference, or a starting point all on its own.

## Start

`npm run start-dev` will make great things happen!

If you want to run the server and/or webpack separately, you can also `npm run start-server` and `npm run build-client`.

From there, just follow your bliss.
